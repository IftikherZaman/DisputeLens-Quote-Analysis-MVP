Important notes:

For pytesseract to work, you need to have Tesseract OCR installed on your system. It's not a Python package, but a separate program. You can download it from the official GitHub repository: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
After installing Tesseract OCR, make sure to add its installation directory to your system's PATH, or specify the path in your Python script as you did in your original code:
pythonCopypytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Users\sajee\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract
